Initial Impressions: Code is not up-to the basic standards, but seems good programatic logics are included.
Naming conventions are not good. - fixed
File names are not decent. Ex; Problem1.ts could be something like CostEstimate.ts - fixed
Class names should be improve. (AppComponent to CostEstimate something like) - fixed
Function names are not well readable. (returnCost() to getCost()  and returnPrice() to getEligibleDiscount()  Function names should be readable based on the what it is doing) - fixed

Variable names are not readable. Some bad naming variables: maxTimeEachArr, final, arr, obj
 Not enough Readme text to understand about the project. - fixed
 No unit testing has done.
Condition statements are not readable. Example in Problem1.ts returnPrice() function.  - fixed

In Problem2.ts, missing readability and maintainability. Function implementations are bit larger and not readable. Splitting into smaller functions would be great.
In finalDiscountedCost() function, two tasks are happening, cost calculation and logging. Avoid doing multiple tasks in a single function.  - There are three task happening in a single function because it includes final implementations. 

Problem2.ts have lots comments and larger functions say traverseDelivery(), findElementsUnderLimit(). Please do necessary refactoring as suggested. - fixed
In Problem2.ts, some empty new lines exists within the code. Please remove them and fix code indentation issues. - fixed
Suggestions
=========
Remove empty code lines and empty functions.
Could be improve if/else block by splitting them into smaller boolean functions.
Avoid unnecessary comments.
Splitting larger functions into small chunks for readability and maintainability.
Make variable names, function names readable according to the context.
Avoid console.log statements in the modules. Have a simple logger module

================================================================================

Separate the code in TimeEstimate.ts, remove lines 99-116 and move them to index.ts.  May be have a folder called TimeEstimate and have TimeEstimate.ts and index.ts files in that. Same for CostEstimate, remove lines 46 and 47 and keep them in index.ts.

In getEligibleDiscount  , why do we need 3 if statement instead of if/else block ? Because those condition statements seems if/else block. Also try to figure out best way to write those condition statements and assign some meaningful variables to those integer constants (distance and weight).

finalDiscountedCost function still have console.log statement. Please avoid it and have a simple logger module instead.
const checkAvailability = this.getEligibleDiscount(weight, distance);  const costWithOutDiscount = this.getCost(baseCost, weight, distance); these two statements in the CostEstimate are bit confusing by their variable names and function names. Say, getEligibleDiscount is returning eligible discount percent, variable name checkAvailability is not best naming to understand.

README should have to improve. Add more info about project, setup process and execution.
Still has no unit testing.
Suggestions
==========
Try to avoid variable names ending with ___Array like maxElementsArray, packagesArray . You don't need to mention it's type in the variable name. Best examples was selectedPackages variable.
Remove empty constructor in CostEstimate
