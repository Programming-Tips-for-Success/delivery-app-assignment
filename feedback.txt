Initial Impressions: Code is not up-to the basic standards, but seems good programatic logics are included.
Naming conventions are not good. - fixed
File names are not decent. Ex; Problem1.ts could be something like CostEstimate.ts - fixed
Class names should be improve. (AppComponent to CostEstimate something like) - fixed
Function names are not well readable. (returnCost() to getCost()  and returnPrice() to getEligibleDiscount()  Function names should be readable based on the what it is doing) - fixed

Variable names are not readable. Some bad naming variables: maxTimeEachArr, final, arr, obj
 Not enough Readme text to understand about the project. - fixed
 No unit testing has done.
Condition statements are not readable. Example in Problem1.ts returnPrice() function.  - fixed

In Problem2.ts, missing readability and maintainability. Function implementations are bit larger and not readable. Splitting into smaller functions would be great.
In finalDiscountedCost() function, two tasks are happening, cost calculation and logging. Avoid doing multiple tasks in a single function.  - There are three task happening in a single function because it includes final implementations. 

Problem2.ts have lots comments and larger functions say traverseDelivery(), findElementsUnderLimit(). Please do necessary refactoring as suggested. - fixed
In Problem2.ts, some empty new lines exists within the code. Please remove them and fix code indentation issues. - fixed
Suggestions
=========
Remove empty code lines and empty functions.
Could be improve if/else block by splitting them into smaller boolean functions.
Avoid unnecessary comments.
Splitting larger functions into small chunks for readability and maintainability.
Make variable names, function names readable according to the context.
Avoid console.log statements in the modules. Have a simple logger module
